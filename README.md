## Kotoba-chan ##

This repository contains only tools for creating databases for the Kotoba-chan Android app found in the kotoba-android repository. The whole project is licensed under GPLv2.

The database source files are bit too big for the git repository so they are hosted separately. Currently the source and 2.0 release files are available at http://yutani.ee/files/kotoba-data-20140319.tar.bz2

It has only been 6 months that I hacked on this project, but I can't remember exactly how and in which order I had to run them.
